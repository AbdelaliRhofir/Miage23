# Exercises

The objectives of these exercises are to get acquainted to the Pharo programming language.
This step is important to correctly follow the rest of the lectures, which will increase in complexity and will assume that you have some mastery of the language.

Of course, you will not be asked to know obscure or implementation specific details of the language.
But, you will need to learn how to write simple programs including:
- classes and methods
- the syntax, operator precedence
- assignments, conditional and loops
- tests

This will also get you started with *reading* code, which will be a recurrent topic in this lecture.
We will need to read and understand code that we did not write.
And we need to do that efficiently.
For that, we first need to take care of the silly obstacules like understanding the syntax.
Later we will know how to abstract a bit more and care less about details.

1. Install Pharo
2. Do ProfStef go 
3. Implement Counter (Check PDF) from [http://mooc.pharo.org](http://mooc.pharo.org)
4. Write report
