### Setup
You have to pick one of each  categories below.

## Kind of packaged ones

- https://github.com/pharo-containers/ 
	(except stack don't be lame)

## Wild ones
- https://github.com/Ducasse/Containers-OrderPreservingTree
- https://github.com/pharo-containers/AVL
- https://github.com/pharo-containers/BTree
- https://github.com/Ducasse/Containers-LinkedList
- https://github.com/Ducasse/Containers-OrderedMultiMap
- https://github.com/Ducasse/Containers-PropertyEnvironment
- https://github.com/Ducasse/Containers-Grid


For each of it perform the following analysis.

## User perspective.
- how to use it
- what is the behavior

## Implementor perspective
- how is it implemented 
- what are the invariants

## Speculate tradeoffs 
-- speed / memory
-- flexibility
-- API

## What about tests
- positive
- negative
- bounds?
- coverage
