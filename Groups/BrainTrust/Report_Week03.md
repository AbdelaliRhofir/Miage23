AGOUAZI Lynda
In this week's lecture:
  - I have learned about Reverse Engineering with the teacher's explanations and some Google searches.
  - In the practice part, I looked at the LRUCache class to figure out what it does, how it works, and how it is made.
    I encountered some challenges in comprehending certain aspects of the class so I turned to Google for assistance with some Youtube videos.
  - Taking advantage of the extra time available, I revisited the project Artefact in order to enhance my understanding of its details.
