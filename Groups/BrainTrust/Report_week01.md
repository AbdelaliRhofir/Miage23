CHAMI Nour :

For the first lecture i would like to summarize the key takeaways from the session in 3 points : 
- A/ We learned about PHARO for OOP , We installed it and learned how to create in order ( packages=> classes => methods). we created a very basic example(a counter) and did several tests(increment, decrement).
- B/ I learned about using GIT and GITHUB , I knew them as concept before , however i never used them until now.
- C/ I faced some problems in my first interaction with Pharo and when trying to load my pharo project into my remote repository ( SSH and HTTPS related problems) , however after reading some PDFs i finally managed to upload it successfully.
