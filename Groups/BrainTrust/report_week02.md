 - In this week's lecture, we reviewed some concepts related to OOP, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and late binding. We also focused on method lookup and completed several examples to help assimilate this important concept.
 - For the exercise part, I looked up one of the presentation's projects (Artefact), uploaded it in Pharo, and ran some demos (I generated some PDF files containing pictures and text). However, I encountered some difficulties when analyzing a project in a new environment I had never used before. Therefore, I am still familiarizing myself with Pharo and inspecting how it works in there.
