Nour Chami: 
 - In this week's lecture, we reviewed some concepts related to OOP, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and late binding. We also focused on method lookup and completed several examples to help assimilate this important concept.
 - For the exercise part, I looked up one of the presentation's projects (Artefact), uploaded it in Pharo, and ran some demos (I generated some PDF files containing pictures and text).
 -  However, I encountered some difficulties when analyzing a project in a new environment I had never used before. Therefore, I am still familiarizing myself with Pharo and inspecting how it works in there.



Lynda Agouazi:
During this week, my progress can be summarized as follows:
  - I have learned some of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts with the teacher's explanations.
  - I finaly understood in a better way github forking.
  - I tried to understand both the projects in the exercise and ran them on pharo environment. I have started with the Artefact project and made a textfile for the important keys i extracted. 
  - I have watched more videos about classes and methods so that i understand the projects in an easy way.
