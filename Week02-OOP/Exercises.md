# Exercises 

For the presentation due in Week 5
- How did you learn?
- Data structure analyses

## Analysis

During this exercise (whose results will have to be presented during week 5) you will have to analyze
two projects: AVL and Artefact

### AVL
 AVL is an implementation of balanced trees

- https://github.com/pharo-containers/AVL

### Artefact
Artefact is a generator of PDF documents.

- https://github.com/pharo-contributions/artefact

To execute the tests use DrTests (see menus)

For each of it perform the following analysis.


### User perspective.
- how to use it?
- what is the behavior?
- what are the key classes?


### Implementor perspective
- how is it implemented 
- what are the invariants
- what is the design?

### What about tests
- positive
- negative
- bounds?
- coverage

### You should propose test improvements
- either improving existing tests 
- or proposing new tests
- if you find problems please open issues in the github repository of the project
- you can also propose PullRequests to address problems and improve the project.
