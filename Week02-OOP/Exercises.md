# Exercises 

For the presentation due in Week 5
- How did you learn?
- Data structure analyses

## Analysis

During this exercises (whose results will have to be presented during week 5) you will have to analyse
two projects: AVL and Artefact

### AVL
 AVL is implementation of balanced trees

- https://github.com/pharo-containers/AVL

### Artefact
Artefact is a generator of PDF document.

- https://github.com/pharo-contributions/artefact

For each of it perform the following analysis.

### User perspective.
- how to use it?
- what is the behavior?

### Implementor perspective
- how is it implemented 
- what are the invariants

### What about tests
- positive
- negative
- bounds?
- coverage

### You should propose test improvements
- either improving existing tests 
- or proposing new tests
